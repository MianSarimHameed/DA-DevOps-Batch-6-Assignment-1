:bulb: **Question No. 1: Agile vs DevOps**<br />
| Topics | Agile | DevOps |
| :---  | :--- | :---  |
| **Definition** | Agile development is a delivery approach that relates to lean manufacturing. The fundamentals of agile center around creating a working prototype or build amidst the realities of changing needs and requirements. Bridging the gap between the development team and the end user, adaptability is a core attribute of agile, giving precedence to the needs of users and stakeholders over rigid plans. | DevOps is a software development practice that brings people, process, and technology together to deliver continuous value. The approach is divided into planning and tracking, development, build and test, delivery, and monitoring and operations. DevOps is unique in that development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security teams work together to create efficiency across all tasks involved in launching a new product, release, or update. |
| **Philosophy & Focus** | The fail-fast mindset of agile centers around adaptability and keeping pace with customer needs and expectations. Features are described as user stories, placing the focus on the individual user, what he or she needs, and why. | Rooted in stability, consistency, and planning, the DevOps culture seeks to identify new ways to improve and streamline processes. As a result, DevOps focuses on maximizing efficiency, identifying programmable processes, and increasing automation. |
| **Scope** | Agile development is specific to the development team, its productivity, and its progress toward completing the project at hand. Development is completed in incremental sprints, and software delivery, deployment, or ongoing maintenance of each release is managed by different teams. | DevOps represents the intersections of development, operations, and quality assurance. Cross-disciplinary teams unite and collaborate in the development and delivery of software. |

:bulb: **Question No. 2: Define Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment** <br /><br />

**1. Continuous Integration** <br />
> Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch. Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.<br />

**2. Continuous Delivery** <br />
> Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button. <br /><br />
In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches that are easy to troubleshoot in case of a problem.<br />

**3. Continuous Deployment** <br />
> Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production. <br /><br />
Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn't a "release day" anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work go live minutes after they've finished working on it.<br />

:bulb: **Question No. 3: Benefits of Cloud Computing**<br />

> Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure Cloud, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
<br /><br />**Benefits:** <br />1. Agility <br />2. Elasticity <br />3. Cost Savings <br />4. Deploy Globally in Minutes<br />

:bulb: **Question No. 4: Difference between Git & GitHub** <br />
| Git (SCM) | GitHub |
| :--- | :--- |
| Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. | GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. |
