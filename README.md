:bulb: **Question No. 1: Agile vs DevOps**<br />
| Topics | Agile | DevOps |
| :---  | :--- | :---  |
| **Definition** | Agile development is a delivery approach that relates to lean manufacturing. The fundamentals of agile center around creating a working prototype or build amidst the realities of changing needs and requirements. Bridging the gap between the development team and the end user, adaptability is a core attribute of agile, giving precedence to the needs of users and stakeholders over rigid plans. | DevOps is a software development practice that brings people, process, and technology together to deliver continuous value. The approach is divided into planning and tracking, development, build and test, delivery, and monitoring and operations. DevOps is unique in that development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security teams work together to create efficiency across all tasks involved in launching a new product, release, or update. |
| **Philosophy & Focus** | The fail-fast mindset of agile centers around adaptability and keeping pace with customer needs and expectations. Features are described as user stories, placing the focus on the individual user, what he or she needs, and why. | Rooted in stability, consistency, and planning, the DevOps culture seeks to identify new ways to improve and streamline processes. As a result, DevOps focuses on maximizing efficiency, identifying programmable processes, and increasing automation. |
| **Scope** | Agile development is specific to the development team, its productivity, and its progress toward completing the project at hand. Development is completed in incremental sprints, and software delivery, deployment, or ongoing maintenance of each release is managed by different teams. | DevOps represents the intersections of development, operations, and quality assurance. Cross-disciplinary teams unite and collaborate in the development and delivery of software. |
